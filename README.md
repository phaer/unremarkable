# unremarkable-notes

Is a work-in-progress rust library to parse and render files from the remarkable2 eink tablet.

It works with the file structure found in `~/.local/share/remarkable/xochitl`, whether they are pure
remarkable notebooks, ePubs or PDFs. Features include higlight- and annotation extraction as well as
rendering via [lines-are-rusty](https://github.com/ax3l/lines-are-rusty).
